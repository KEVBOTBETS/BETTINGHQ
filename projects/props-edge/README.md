# Props Edge

Props Edge is a static GitHub Pages dashboard for NFL, NCAAF, MLB, and WNBA player props. It follows a secure hybrid data model:

1. Odds-API.io, when its GitHub Actions secret is configured.
2. The Odds API, when its GitHub Actions secret is configured and the primary feed has no props.
3. ESPN public schedules and box scores as a keyless projection-only fallback.

Sportsbook odds produce model-ranked **Best**, **Good**, and **Lean** rows. ESPN has player statistics but no sportsbook prices, so its fallback rows are clearly labeled **Projections**, not bets. Current sportsbook lines can also be imported as a CSV and evaluated locally in the browser.

Qualified plays are displayed in three separate Best, Good, and Lean areas. Every qualified card has an **Add to ledger** button. The ledger stores the selection, line, odds, edge, editable stake, result status, and calculated profit/loss. It can be exported to CSV.

## NFL Pro upgrade

- A dedicated NFL Prop Command Center appears when the NFL tab is selected.
- NFL filters include touchdowns, passing, rushing, receiving, targets, defense, and kicking.
- Supported NFL projections and normalized odds markets include passing yards, completions, attempts, touchdowns and interceptions; rushing yards, carries and touchdowns; receiving yards, receptions, targets and touchdowns; anytime touchdowns; longest-play props; field goals, kicking points, tackles plus assists, and sacks when the source publishes them.
- Anytime-touchdown Yes/No prices are evaluated with a conservative touchdown-frequency model instead of being treated as a normal over/under line.
- The default NFL bankroll is $500, quarter-Kelly staking is used, and a single recommendation is capped at $50.
- The NFL dashboard shows starting bankroll, open exposure, available bankroll, settled profit/loss and ROI.

## Fast GitHub setup

1. Create a new public GitHub repository named `props-edge`.
2. Unzip this project and upload the files and folders inside it to the repository root.
3. Commit the upload to the `main` branch.
4. Open **Settings → Pages** and choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
5. Open **Actions → Refresh Props Edge → Run workflow**.

The workflow refreshes automatically five times per day and redeploys the page. It can also be run at any time from GitHub Actions or through the dashboard's **Run GitHub update** link. The **Game date** selector lets you isolate today, tomorrow, or any other available scheduled day in the seven-day window.

## Add private odds-provider keys (optional)

Any key previously pasted into chat, source code, or another public location must be revoked and replaced at the provider before use.

For each replacement key:

1. In the new repository, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
2. Choose **New repository secret**.
3. Create `ODDS_API_IO_KEY` for Odds-API.io.
4. Create `THE_ODDS_API_KEY` for The Odds API.
5. Paste each replacement value only into its matching secret and save it.
6. Run **Actions → Refresh Props Edge → Run workflow**.

Do not put a key in an Actions variable, `.env` file, JSON file, JavaScript, HTML, issue, commit message, or workflow text. The workflow reads the two repository secrets only during the private data-build step. It publishes player, market, price, model, and source fields—not credentials or provider request URLs. Provider errors are sanitized before they reach public JSON.

The `.gitignore` excludes `.env` files. The automated tests also reject long secret-shaped hexadecimal tokens before each refresh.

## Run without any API keys

No setup is required. The workflow automatically uses ESPN's public schedules and recent box scores. When enough recent player samples and an upcoming matchup exist, the site displays projection cards. ESPN does not publish sportsbook prop odds, so it cannot calculate price-based expected value by itself.

This mode may legitimately show no rows during an offseason, before schedules are posted, or before players have enough recent games.

## Import current sportsbook lines

On the dashboard, choose **Download CSV template**, enter current lines, then choose **Import sportsbook lines**. Required columns are:

```csv
sport,player,market,line,over_odds,under_odds,yes_odds,no_odds,book,matchup
NFL,Player Name,Receiving yards,64.5,-110,-110,,,DraftKings,Away @ Home
NFL,Player Name,Anytime touchdown,,,,+150,,DraftKings,Away @ Home
```

The CSV is read only by that browser tab and is not uploaded, committed, or retained after the page closes. Player and market names must match a displayed ESPN projection.

## Bet ledger

- Choose **Add to ledger** on any Best, Good, or Lean card.
- Change the stake and set the result to Pending, Win, Loss, Push, or Void.
- Win/loss profit is calculated from the saved American price and stake.
- Add closing odds to calculate CLV, and keep injury, role, or line-movement notes with the bet.
- The dashboard calculates open exposure, available bankroll, settled P/L, and ROI.
- Choose **Export ledger CSV** to download the complete ledger.
- Ledger entries use browser storage and persist on that browser and device. They are not uploaded to GitHub and do not automatically sync to another phone or computer.

## Data and model rules

- DraftKings is the target book for automatically priced plays. FanDuel is the second primary comparison book so the free Odds-API.io account stays within its two-book maximum.
- Generic odds-provider labels are normalized into real prop markets, including the full NFL group above, MLB batter and pitcher props, and WNBA points, rebounds, assists, threes, and combination props.
- Consensus probabilities use complete two-sided prices from at least two books and remove the two-way market margin before comparison.
- If DraftKings has a current price but fewer than two consensus books are available, the model can conservatively compare that price with the matching ESPN player projection. These cards are explicitly labeled `DraftKings price vs ESPN projection`.
- Model probabilities are shrunk toward 50% to reduce overconfidence.
- A positive expected value and at least a 2% model edge are required for a Lean; 4% is Good and 6% is Best.
- Prices outside -250 to +500 are rejected, except NFL anytime-touchdown prices may extend to +750 because that market naturally contains longer odds; the conservative touchdown model and $50 stake cap still apply.
- ESPN projections use up to eight recent player games, weight recent games more heavily, and show the sample count and confidence.
- Action Network and OddsShark are not scraped because automated extraction is prohibited or blocked. Sportsbook sites can also be geo-, age-, and bot-gated, so they are not a reliable unattended GitHub Actions feed.

This is an informational model, not a promise of profit. Verify the player, market, line, price, and availability at the sportsbook before betting, and use legal age and responsible-gambling limits.
