    classification flag on the team object itself (the site API's own /teams
    endpoint ignores the groups filter and happily returns Division III
    schools), so this infers it from behaviour instead.

    The strongest available signal is how OFTEN a team appears. An FBS program
    plays a dozen games against opponents this feed can see, so it turns up a
    dozen times. An FCS school appears only for the one or two payout games it
    takes, because the rest of its season is invisible at groups=80. Counting
    beats the older "is it ever the home team" rule, which quietly promoted any
    FCS school that happened to host a buy game -- North Dakota State hosting
    an FBS visitor was enough to have it priced as an FBS peer.

    The bar adapts to how much schedule is actually cached: with only a couple
    of weeks pulled, everyone looks infrequent, so it falls back to the older
