"""
The full prediction record — every market the model has ever priced, graded,
whether or not it was ever bet.

The Bet Ledger only tells you about the bets you actually placed, and that's
inherently a biased sample: it's exactly the games where the model disagreed
most with the market, which is where its own error is largest (the winner's
curse the tiering already corrects for). A model that only ever gets judged on
its bets can't be told apart from a model that got lucky on a small selected
slice.

This module keeps the other, much larger, much less biased dataset: what the
model said about EVERY game it saw a price for -- PASS included -- logged once
at first sight and graded once the result is in, with the same discipline as
the ledger (never re-priced after the fact). Over a season that's thousands of
graded predictions instead of a few dozen bets, which is what it actually takes
to tell a 3-point calibration gap from noise.
