"""
Edge model: projection -> probability -> price comparison -> tier -> stake.

Three things here are meaningfully better than the spreadsheet version:

1. KEY NUMBERS. The workbook converted a projected margin into a cover
   probability with NORMSDIST -- a smooth bell curve. Football margins are not
   smooth. Games land on 3 and 7 far more often than a normal curve says, which
   is why the difference between -2.5 and -3.5 is worth real money and the
   difference between -5.5 and -6.5 is worth almost nothing. A smooth model
   systematically overpays to buy off 3 and underrates every number next to it.
   We build a discrete margin distribution instead, bumped at the key numbers,
   which also gives us honest push probabilities on whole-number spreads.

2. PROPER DE-VIGGING. Comparing a model probability against a raw
   vig-inclusive implied probability conflates "I disagree with the market" with
   "the book charges juice". The two get separated: the market's *fair* opinion
   is the de-vigged number, and the price you have to beat is the break-even
   number. Edge is measured against the second; disagreement against the first.

3. CONFIDENCE-AWARE OUTPUT. A 6% edge built on two games of data in week 2 is
   not the same bet as a 6% edge in week 10, and the model says so instead of
   quietly pretending otherwise.
