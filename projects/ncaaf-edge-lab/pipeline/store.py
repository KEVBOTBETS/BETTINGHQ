"""
Persistent state, committed back to the repo by the scheduled job.

Two things have to survive between runs because they cannot be re-derived later:

  lines.json   Every odds snapshot we have ever seen for a game. ESPN drops odds
               from the scoreboard the moment a game goes final, so if we don't
               record the number we bet into, we can never grade the bet or
               measure closing line value. The first snapshot is the opener, the
               last one before kickoff is the close.

  ledger.json  The bet log. A bet is written once, at the moment the model
               qualified it, and then only ever graded -- never re-priced. This
               is what stops the record from being quietly rewritten every time
               the ratings move, which is the classic way a "model" ends up with
               a fake winning history.
