# MLB Edge — setup and updates, start to finish

Written for someone who has never used GitHub. No coding. About 20 minutes the
first time, then it runs itself.

**What you end up with:** a web address of your own that rebuilds the whole model
nine times a day and shows today's slate, and that address dropped into your Wix
page so it appears as part of your site.

**What you need:** the `mlb-edge.zip` file, an email address, and a free GitHub
account. No credit card. Nothing to install.

---

## Part 1 — Install it (you do this once)

### Step 1. Unzip the file

Double-click `mlb-edge.zip`. You get a folder called **mlb-edge**. Open it. You
should see roughly this:

```
.github/        data/       docs/       pipeline/
tests/          tools/      README.md   SETUP.md      requirements.txt
```

Leave that window open — you will drag from it in Step 4.

> Some computers hide folders whose name starts with a dot, so you may not see
> `.github`. That is fine and expected. Step 5 handles it.

### Step 2. Make a GitHub account

Go to **github.com** and click **Sign up**. Free plan. Pick any username — it
becomes part of your web address, so `chillychilly14` gives you
`chillychilly14.github.io/mlb-edge`.

### Step 3. Create the repository

A repository ("repo") is just a folder that lives on GitHub.

1. Top-right, click the **+** → **New repository**
2. **Repository name:** `mlb-edge` (lower case, with the hyphen)
3. Choose **Public**
   *This matters.* Free GitHub Pages and unlimited free Actions minutes only
   apply to public repos. Nothing private is in here — no passwords, no keys.
4. Leave every checkbox **unticked** (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
5. Click **Create repository**

You land on a mostly empty page with setup instructions. Ignore all of it.

### Step 4. Upload the files

1. On that page find the link **uploading an existing file** and click it.
   (If you cannot see it: **Add file** → **Upload files**.)
2. Go back to your unzipped **mlb-edge** folder.
3. Select **everything inside it** — not the folder itself, its contents.
   Windows: click one item, then Ctrl+A. Mac: click one item, then Cmd+A.
4. Drag the selection into the browser window.
5. Wait until every file finishes. It is a couple of hundred small files.
6. Scroll down, click **Commit changes**.

You should now see `docs`, `pipeline`, `tests`, `tools`, `data`, `README.md` and
`requirements.txt` listed in your repo.

### Step 5. Add the automation file

This is the file that makes everything run by itself. It lives in a hidden
folder, so we create it directly on GitHub instead of relying on the drag.

1. Click the **Actions** tab at the top of your repo.
2. **If you see a workflow called "Build MLB slate"** — the upload worked, the
   hidden folder came through. Skip to Step 6.
3. **If you see a "Get started with GitHub Actions" page** — click
   **set up a workflow yourself**.
4. An editor opens with some starter text. Select all of it and delete it.
5. Open `.github/workflows/build.yml` from the unzipped folder in a plain text
   editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac) and copy everything.
   *Can't find the `.github` folder?*
   Windows: File Explorer → **View** → tick **Hidden items**.
   Mac: in Finder press **Cmd + Shift + .** (period) to show hidden files.
6. Paste it into the GitHub editor.
7. At the top, change the filename box to `build.yml`.
8. Click **Commit changes** → **Commit changes** again.

### Step 6. Turn the website on

1. Click **Settings** (top of the repo, far right).
2. Left sidebar → **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

There is no save button. It applies immediately.

### Step 7. Run it for the first time

1. Click the **Actions** tab.
2. If it asks, click **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**.
3. Left sidebar → **Build MLB slate**.
4. Right side → **Run workflow** → green **Run workflow** button.
5. Refresh after a few seconds. A yellow dot means running, a green tick means
   done. It takes about 4–8 minutes the first time.

### Step 8. Open your dashboard

**Settings** → **Pages**. At the top is your address:

```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/mlb-edge/
```

Click it. You should see today's games. Bookmark it.

> If it says "No feed for this date yet", the build has not finished. Wait for
> the green tick in the Actions tab and refresh.

---

## Part 2 — Put it on your Wix site

1. Open your site in the **Wix Editor**.
2. **Add** (the **+**) → **Embed Code** → **Embed a Site**.
3. A box appears. Click **Enter Website Address** and paste your address.
4. Drag the box wide — full width of the page.
5. Drag it tall. **1400 px** is a good starting height on mobile; **2200 px** if
   most of your visitors are on a computer. The dashboard scrolls inside the box
   either way, so too short is annoying but not broken.
6. **Publish**.

### Address options

Add these to the end of your address to change how it opens:

| Add this | What it does |
|---|---|
| `?theme=light` | forces the light color scheme — use it if your Wix page is white |
| `?theme=dark` | forces dark, whatever the visitor's phone is set to |
| `?tab=bets` | opens straight to today's card |
| `?tab=mine` | opens straight to My Ledger |

Combine them with `&`, like
`https://YOU.github.io/mlb-edge/?theme=light&tab=bets`.

---

## Part 3 — Using it

**It updates itself.** Nine times a day: just after midnight Eastern so the new
day exists before anyone looks, early morning, late morning, afternoon, when
lineups post, before first pitch, mid-evening, late, and a pre-dawn pass that
grades everything that finished. You do not have to do anything.

**The page keeps itself current too.** It works out today's date from your own
phone or computer rather than from whenever the build last ran, checks for a new
build every five minutes, rolls over to the next day by itself at midnight, and
refreshes when you come back to the tab. If today's slate has not been built yet
it shows the most recent one and says so, rather than going blank.

**To force a refresh right now:** Actions tab → **Build MLB slate** →
**Run workflow**. Give it five minutes.

**Reading a game:** each card shows the projected score, both win percentages
after the market blend, the total against the book's number, and the single best
number in the game with its tier. Tap **Full breakdown** for the starters, the
run distribution and every market.

**Tracking a bet:** tap **+ Ledger** on any LEAN, GOOD or BEST BET. It saves at
that price with the suggested stake. Open **My Ledger** to change the stake, and
it settles itself once the game finishes.

**Back up your ledger.** It lives in your browser, so clearing your browsing data
erases it. In My Ledger tap **Export JSON** every so often and keep the file.
**Import** puts it back.

### The simulator

The **Simulator** tab (or the **Simulate** button on any game card) opens that
game in the same engine the build uses, running in your browser. Everything that
moves the score is a control:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| Starter sharper / worse | makes that pitcher better or worse by up to 25% |
| Pulled earlier / later | how many batters he faces before the bullpen comes in |
| Bullpen sharper / worse | the same, for the relief corps |
| Lineup | tap any hitter to sit him and drop a replacement-level bat in |
| Weather run environment | colder and blowing in, or hot and blowing out |
| Park run environment | play the same game in a bigger or smaller yard |
| Simulations | more runs, less noise, slower |

Every result is shown next to what the build published, with the change in
percentage points, plus the fair price for each market. The note underneath
tells you how much sampling noise there is at your simulation count — anything
smaller than that is not a real move.

### Looking ahead

Under the tabs there is a strip of dates running about a week out. Each one says
what is actually ready on that day — how many games, how many are priced, how
many plays there are.

Games arrive in stages, and every card says which stage it is at:

| Chip | Means |
|---|---|
| **ready** | priced, both starters posted, lineups confirmed — the full picture |
| **priced** | priced, both starters posted, lineups not out yet |
| **no prices yet** | starters known, no book has hung a number |
| **starter TBA** | nobody has announced a pitcher |
| **live** | in progress, or finished |

The model publishes its own fair line at every stage, so you can shop a game
before a price exists. But it only sizes real stakes for today and tomorrow.
Anything further out is a read, not a bet, because the number will move before
you can take it.

### Every game gets scored, bet or not

Separately from your ledger, the model records a prediction for **every game on
the schedule** — who wins, how likely, and the projected score — and grades all
of them when the games finish. That is the **Game predictions** panel on the
Accuracy tab: how often it picks winners, how far off the scores are, whether it
is better or worse than the market at calling games.

Once 150 games are graded it starts correcting itself: if projections have been
running a run high, it shifts them down; if it has been too confident, it dials
confidence back. Both corrections are capped, and the panel says exactly what is
being applied and where it came from.

## Part 4 — Changing a setting

### The easy way: bankroll

**Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **Variables** tab →
**New repository variable**.

| Name | Value | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `MLB_BANKROLL` | `250` | the bankroll all staking is sized from |
| `MLB_SEASON` | `2026` | which season's stats to use |

Then run the workflow once so it picks the change up.

### Which sportsbook's prices you see

Every price on a card is **DraftKings'** by default, so the number the model
shows is the number in your app. To change that:

1. In your repo click **pipeline**, then **config.py**.
2. Click the **pencil** icon.
3. Find `PREFERRED_BOOK = "DraftKings"` near the top and change it to `"FanDuel"`,
   `"ESPN BET"`, `"Caesars"`, `"BetMGM"` or `"Bet365"`.
4. **Commit changes**, then Actions → **Run workflow**.

Set it to `None` (no quotes) and the model goes back to showing the best price
available anywhere in the feed.

Two things worth knowing:

- If your book has not posted a market, you get the best price that *is* posted,
  and the chip on the card says `no DraftKings price` so you know why.
- Where a different book has a better number, it is printed underneath in green
  — that is money you are leaving on the table by not shopping.

### Checking a price yourself

Under every game there is a fold-out: **Every book's number for this game**.
It is the raw feed, one row per book, with your book's row highlighted. If a
number on a card is not somewhere in that table, that is a bug and worth telling
me about.

A dash in that table means the book has not posted that market. **The model never
fills a dash in.** It prices its own fair line instead, marks it *fair (model)*,
and does not bet it.

### Everything else: `pipeline/config.py`

1. In your repo click **pipeline**, then **config.py**.
2. Click the **pencil** icon (top right of the file).
3. Change the number you want. Every line has a comment explaining it.
4. Scroll down → **Commit changes** → **Commit changes**.
5. Actions → **Build MLB slate** → **Run workflow**.

The settings people actually change:

| Setting | Default | Raise it to… | Lower it to… |
|---|---|---|---|
| `KELLY_FRACTION` | `0.25` | bet more per edge | bet less |
| `MAX_STAKE_PCT` | `0.05` | allow bigger single bets | cap them tighter |
| `TIER_BEST` | `0.035` | make BEST BET rarer | make it more common |
| `TIER_GOOD` | `0.025` | fewer GOOD calls | more |
| `MARKET_BLEND` | `0.40` | trust the market more | trust the model more |
| `MAX_PLAYS_PER_SLATE` | `6` | more bets per day | fewer |
| `MAX_SLATE_EXPOSURE_PCT` | `0.15` | more money at risk daily | less |
| `N_SIMS` | `20000` | more precision, slower builds | faster builds |
| `LOOKAHEAD_DAYS` | `7` | see further ahead, slower builds | faster builds |
| `STAKE_MAX_DAYS_OUT` | `1` | size stakes further ahead | today only |
| `RECENT_WEIGHT_BAT` | `0.30` | weight the last 30 days more | trust the season |
| `HR_REGRESS_PITCHER` | `0.55` | trust league average on home runs | trust the pitcher |
| `CALIBRATION_ENABLED` | `True` | — | set `False` to stop it self-correcting |
| `CALIBRATION_MIN_GAMES` | `150` | wait for more history first | start correcting sooner |

> Careful with `KELLY_FRACTION` and `MAX_STAKE_PCT`. Those two are what the
> audit in your old workbook said had done the damage — a 55% win rate with a
> −24% return is a staking problem, not a picking problem.

## Part 5 — Installing an update

When you get a new `mlb-edge.zip`:

1. **First, back up your ledger.** Open the dashboard → **My Ledger** →
   **Export JSON** → save the file.
2. Unzip the new version.
3. **Delete `data/shadow.json` AND `data/predictions.json` from the new unzipped
   folder.** Those two files in your repo hold every graded bet call and every
   graded game prediction the model has made. The copies in the zip are empty and
   would wipe your history — including the accuracy record the model corrects
   itself from. (If you forget, or if they were never there in the first place,
   the build no longer breaks over it — it recreates them empty and carries on.)
4. In your repo: **Add file** → **Upload files**.
5. Select everything inside the new unzipped folder and drag it in. Same-named
   files are replaced; your history is untouched.
6. **Commit changes**.
7. If the update changed `.github/workflows/build.yml`, redo Step 5 from Part 1
   to paste the new version.
8. Actions → **Build MLB slate** → **Run workflow**.

Nothing about your dashboard address changes. Anyone with the Wix page keeps
seeing it, updated.

## Part 6 — When something looks wrong

| What you see | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Red ✗ on the workflow run | the build failed | See **Reading a failed run** just below this table. Most often a data source was briefly down; running it again fixes it. |
| Amber ⚠ on a **Self-test** step | an internal check drifted | Not a failure. The site still builds and deploys. Worth telling me about, not worth stopping for. |
| `Get Pages site failed` | Pages was never switched on | Settings → Pages → Source = **GitHub Actions**, then run the workflow again. |
| "No feed for this date yet" | no build has finished for that date | Actions → Run workflow, wait for the green tick, refresh. |
| Page loads but every game says **no price** | ESPN had no odds posted yet | Normal early in the morning. Odds appear through the day; the next build picks them up. |
| **404** at your github.io address | Pages is not switched on, or the first build has not finished | Settings → Pages → Source = **GitHub Actions**, then run the workflow. |
| Wix shows an empty white box | the address is wrong or missing `https://` | Re-copy it from Settings → Pages. It must start with `https://`. |
| The dashboard is there but tiny/cut off | the Wix embed box is too short | In the Wix editor drag the box taller. It does not resize itself. |
| My Ledger is empty | browser data was cleared, or you are on a different device | It is stored per browser. Import the JSON you exported. |
| Same numbers all day | you are looking at a cached page | Pull down to refresh, or add `?x=1` to the address. The page also re-checks every five minutes on its own. |
| A banner says today's slate is not built yet | the overnight run has not landed | It should arrive within the hour. If it has not, check the Actions tab - the job may be failing. |
| A banner says the feed is hours old | the scheduled job is failing | Actions tab, open the newest run, read the red step. |
| Red **divergence flag** banner | the model disagrees with the market on an unusual share of the slate | Usually a data problem, not free money. The model already capped its own best bets. Treat that day's edges with suspicion. |
| Lots of games say **lineups projected** | batting orders are not posted yet | Normal until a few hours before first pitch. Best bets need confirmed starters, so more appear as the day goes on. |
| A market shows no price at all | no book in the feed has posted that market yet | Expected on run lines and totals early in the day. The model publishes its fair line so you can shop it. It will not bet a market nobody has priced. |
| A price does not match your app | your book had not posted it, so you are seeing another book's | The card names the book under every price, and the fold-out shows all of them. If your book's row has a number and the card shows a different one, that is a bug. |
| Later days say **no prices yet** | books have not hung numbers that far out | Expected — books post two or three days ahead. The model publishes its own fair line so you can shop it when the number lands. |
| Future days show no stakes at all | stakes are only sized for today and tomorrow | Deliberate: a price four days out will move before you can take it. Change `STAKE_MAX_DAYS_OUT` in `config.py` if you disagree. |
| **Learning from it: not applied yet** | fewer than 150 games graded so far | It fills up on its own — about a week and a half of full slates. |
| A club shows a big **run bias** | the model consistently misreads that roster | Worth knowing before you back them. It usually shrinks as the sample grows. |

### Reading a failed run

Two places to look, in this order.

**1. The Summary page.** Actions → click the run → the **Summary** page opens
first. Every run now writes a short "MLB Edge build" block there: which date it
built, how many games, how many were priced, how much was staked. If that block
is there, the model itself ran fine even if something later went red.

**2. The red step.** On the same run page, click **build** in the left column.
Each step is a line you can click open. The one with the red ✗ is the one that
broke. Scroll to the bottom of it — the useful line is almost always the last
one that is *not* indented.

An amber ⚠ on a step named **Self-test** is not a failure. Those four steps
report, they do not gate: the site still builds and deploys. They are there so
you can see when something has drifted, not to stop your dashboard updating.

**If you want me to fix it:** copy the last ten or so lines out of the red step
and paste them to me. Everything else is guesswork without them.

## Part 7 — What the words mean

| Term | Plain English |
|---|---|
| **Edge** | how much better the model thinks a price is than the book does, as a percentage of what you stake. `+3.2%` means the model expects to make 3.2 cents per dollar. |
| **Book price** | a real number a named sportsbook is actually showing right now. If it says DraftKings, DraftKings is quoting it. |
| **Fair (model)** | the model's own opinion of what the price *should* be. Not an offer from anyone. Never bet it as if it were. |
| **Fair** | the price the model thinks the bet *should* be. If the book is longer than fair, that is where the edge comes from. |
| **Model %** | the model's chance of the bet winning, after being pulled toward the market. |
| **Market %** | the book's chance, with its own margin taken out. |
| **No-vig** | the book's price with its built-in profit removed, so it can be compared with the model fairly. |
| **Tier** | how much the model likes it: BEST BET, GOOD, LEAN, PASS. |
| **Kelly** | the math for how much to bet given an edge. This uses a quarter of it, which is deliberately conservative. |
| **Run line** | the baseball version of a spread, almost always 1.5 runs. |
| **F5 / first five** | just the first five innings. No bullpen, so often the cleanest read. |
| **Total** | the combined runs both teams score. Over or under the book's number. |
| **CLV** | closing line value — whether the price you took was better than where the market ended up. Beating the close is the best short-run evidence an edge was real. |
| **Shadow book** | every call the model makes, graded, including the ones it told you to skip. That is how you know if the tiers are set right. |
| **Park factor** | how much a stadium adds or subtracts. `112/111` means 12% more runs and 11% more home runs than average. |
| **Power rating / True W%** | what the model thinks a roster would do against average opposition, ignoring luck and schedule. |
| **Consensus** | the middle opinion across every sportsbook in the feed, with the margin removed. Edges are measured against this, not against the best price — otherwise shopping alone would look like an edge. |
| **Best price** | the most generous number on offer for that bet, and the book offering it. This is the one you would actually take. |
| **Readiness** | how complete a game's picture is: ready, priced, no prices yet, starter TBA, live. |
| **NRFI** | "no run first inning" — neither team scores in the first. |
| **Team total** | one club's runs, over or under a number, rather than the two combined. |
| **Brier score** | how good the win probabilities are, not just the picks. Lower is better; 0.25 is a coin flip. The market's score sits next to the model's. |
| **Calibration** | whether things called 60% actually happen 60% of the time. |
| **Run bias** | how far the projected score sits from the real one on average. Positive means the model reads high. |

---

## Still stuck?

Open the **Actions** tab, click the most recent run, and copy the last twenty
lines of whichever step is red. That is almost always enough to tell what went
wrong.
