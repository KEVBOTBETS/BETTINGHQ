"""Legacy server-ledger helpers retained for state-file compatibility.

The active site uses browser-local My Ledger. A wager enters it only after the
user reviews the current price and clicks Add to My Ledger. The build does not
call ``open_bet`` and publishes an empty compatibility ledger.

Closing line value is computed as a separate, honest scorecard: the probability
you locked in versus the probability the market settled on. Over a few hundred
bets CLV predicts long-run profit far better than win rate does, and it tells
you whether the model is finding real edges or just getting lucky.
