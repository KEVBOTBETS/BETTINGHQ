"""
The shadow book: grade EVERY call the model makes, including the ones it passed.

The bet ledger answers "did I make money". This answers a different and more
important question: "do the labels mean anything".

A tier is a claim. BEST BET claims it will win more often than GOOD, which
claims it beats LEAN, which claims it beats the plays the model threw away. That
claim is testable, but only if the passes are recorded too -- and a ledger that
only holds the bets you placed structurally cannot test it. If PASS plays win at
the same rate as BEST BETs, the tiering is decoration and the whole staking plan
is built on sand. You cannot find that out from a P/L column.

So every candidate the model prices is written here once, at the moment it is
first seen, frozen with the line, price, probability, confidence and tier it had
at that moment. When the game goes final, all of them are graded at a flat one
unit, whether or not a dollar was ever risked. That gives:

  * win rate and flat-stake ROI by tier -- the direct test of the labels
  * the same by market, by side, by favourite/underdog, by week, by confidence
  * calibration: when the model says 58%, does 58% happen
  * tier separation: the single number that says whether the ordering holds

Frozen at first sighting, never re-priced. A record that quietly updates itself
to whatever the model thinks now is how every home-made model ends up with a
beautiful fake history.
