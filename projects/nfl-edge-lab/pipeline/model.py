Edge model: projection -> probability -> price comparison -> tier -> stake.

Five things here are meaningfully better than the spreadsheet this replaced.

1. KEY NUMBERS. The workbook turned a projected margin into a cover probability
   with NORM.S.DIST -- a smooth bell curve. NFL margins are the least smooth
   distribution in sport. Roughly one game in seven lands exactly on 3, and one
   in fourteen on 7, because of how scoring works. That is why -2.5 and -3.5 are
   different bets and -5.5 and -6.5 are nearly the same one. A smooth curve
   systematically overpays to buy off 3 and misprices every number beside it.
   This builds a discrete margin distribution with the real spikes in it, which
   also produces honest push probabilities on whole numbers.

2. TIES ARE PUSHES. The workbook priced an NFL tie as impossible and graded it
   as a loss. Ties are rare (~0.2% of games) but they are real, and a moneyline
   tie is refunded, not lost. Pricing that correctly is worth a fraction of a
   percent -- which is the same order as the edges being hunted, so it matters.

3. PROPER DE-VIGGING. Comparing a model probability to a raw, vig-inclusive
   implied probability confuses "I disagree with the market" with "the book
   charges juice". Those get separated here: the market's *fair* opinion is the
   de-vigged number, and the price you must beat is the break-even number. Model
   edge is measured against the first; realized value and stake safety are
   measured separately at the second.

4. EDGE COMPRESSION. The single biggest flaw in home-made betting models is that
   they report enormous edges. A model that says it has found 15% on an NFL
   side against a market with billions of dollars and every sharp in the country
   pricing it has not found 15%; it has found a bug in itself. Raw edge is
   squeezed through a tanh so small edges pass through almost untouched and
   large ones asymptote toward a ceiling. Both numbers are kept, so the
   compression is visible rather than hidden.

5. LOCK RULES. "BEST BET" now has to earn the label on more than one axis: a
   real edge, enough data to trust the rating, a line the model actually
   disagrees with, and a price worth taking. A big probability edge on a line
   the model agrees with is an artefact of the price, not a read on the game.
