"""
Team statistics, derived from results and enriched from ESPN.

Two sources, on purpose.

DERIVED stats are computed from the game log this pipeline already holds: points
for and against, margin, home/away splits, recent form, ATS and over/under
records, scoring by half of the season. These can never break, never need a key,
and are exactly the numbers used to justify a projection -- so the reasoning
shown on a game card is always backed by something the pipeline can prove.

ENRICHED stats come from ESPN's team statistics feed: yards per play, third-down
rate, turnover margin, sacks, red-zone efficiency. Richer, but a third-party
schema that can change shape without warning, so every failure degrades to an
empty panel instead of a broken build.

Neither set feeds the ratings. The ridge solve learns team strength from margins
already; bolting yards-per-play on top would double-count the same evidence and
make the model look better informed than it is. These exist to EXPLAIN a
projection to a person, which is a different job from making one.
