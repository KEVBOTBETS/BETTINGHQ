"""
The forecast log: what the model said about every game, and what happened.

The bet ledger asks "did I make money". The shadow book asks "do the labels
mean anything". This asks the question underneath both of them, and the only one
that is really about the model rather than about the staking plan:

    Does this thing predict football games?

Every game the model prices gets a forecast recorded before kickoff -- projected
margin, projected total, projected score, win probability -- alongside the
market's number for the same game. When the game finals, both are graded against
what actually happened.

That last part is the whole point. A model's absolute error is meaningless in
isolation: NFL margins have a standard deviation over thirteen points, so
*everyone* is wrong by a lot. The number that matters is the comparison. If the
market's closing spread predicts final margins more accurately than this model
does, then the model has no business disagreeing with it, and no amount of
threshold tuning or Kelly fraction will fix that. If the model is even slightly
closer, that difference is where an edge could live.

Two forecasts are kept for each game, not one:

  first   what the model said the moment the game came into view, days out
  latest  what it said on the last run before kickoff

Comparing those two answers a question that would otherwise be invisible: does
the model actually get better as the week goes on and information arrives, or is
it just moving with the market? A model whose late forecast is no better than
its early one is not learning from the injury report -- it is following the line.

Nothing here is a bet. Games are recorded whether or not anything was staked,
which is what makes this a measurement of the model rather than a measurement of
the bets that happened to clear a threshold.
