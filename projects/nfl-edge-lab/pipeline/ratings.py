"""
Self-updating team power ratings.

This is the piece the spreadsheet could never do. The workbook derived every
rating from one hand-typed number per team -- the market's season win total --
and then left it frozen all year. Half of those numbers were wrong the day the
file was made, and all of them were stale by October. Here the win totals are
only the PRESEASON PRIOR, and from Week 1 onward the ratings are solved from
results, so they update themselves every time a game goes final.

Method: ridge-regularised least squares on margin of victory.

    margin(home - away)  ~=  r_home - r_away + hfa * (0 if neutral else 1)

Solved jointly across every game in the sample, so a team's rating is its
strength net of who it played -- strength of schedule is handled structurally
rather than bolted on as a fudge factor. Four details do most of the work:

  * Ridge penalty. Without it, a 3-0 team that played nobody gets an absurd
    rating and the system is near-singular in Week 1. The penalty pulls each
    rating toward its prior in proportion to how little evidence supports it,
    which is correct Bayesian behaviour rather than a hack.
  * MOV cap. A 44-6 Thursday night game is not six times more informative than a
    24-18 one. Capping margin keeps garbage time from setting the ratings.
  * Recency half-life, measured in days. September tells you less about December
    than November does.
  * Market win totals as the anchor. The market's August opinion beats last
    season's results on its own, because the market has already priced the
    coaching change, the draft, the free agency class and the quarterback.

Totals get their own solve: points scored is modelled as league average plus the
scoring team's offence minus the conceding team's defence, which projects each
side of a matchup individually instead of averaging two season scoring rates.
