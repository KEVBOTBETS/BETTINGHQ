Market-implied power ratings: what the betting market thinks each team is worth.

Every point spread is a statement about two teams at once. A season of spreads
is therefore an over-determined system that can be solved for a rating per team,
exactly the way the results-based solve works -- only the target is the number
the market posted rather than the score that happened.

Two reasons this earns its place.

**It is a far better early-season prior than anything else available.** In Week 2
the results-based ratings have one game each to work with and are mostly noise.
The market, by contrast, has already priced the draft, free agency, the new
coordinator and the quarterback's ankle, and it has done so with real money. Its
Week 2 opinion is worth more than a whole month of the model's own.

**It makes disagreement legible at the team level.** The board already shows
where the model disagrees with the market on a single game. This shows where it
disagrees about a *team*: "we have Detroit 1.8 points above where the market has
them" is a much more useful thing to know than sixteen separate game-level gaps,
because it tells you whether an edge is one situation or one opinion showing up
sixteen times. If every play on the card is powered by the same team-level
disagreement, that is one bet, not six -- and this is where you see it.

Used only as a minority preseason prior and faded to zero as results arrive.
The per-game anchor in model.blend_to_market already pulls the final projection
toward that game's number, so letting spread ratings replace the independent
prior would apply the same correction twice and leave the model with no opinion.
